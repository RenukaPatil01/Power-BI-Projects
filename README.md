# Power-BI-Projects

Developed two end-to-end interactive dashboards using Power BI, focused on retail and eCommerce business intelligence.

Blinkit Project: Analyzed multi-year outlet and product sales data to uncover trends in customer behavior, delivery efficiency, and item performance. Used DAX, filters, and KPIs to visualize regional insights and recommend business improvements.

Shopify Project: Built a comprehensive sales and customer analytics dashboard, integrating key metrics like repeat rate, average order value, and payment method trends. Included geographic sales mapping and product-level breakdowns to support marketing and inventory planning.

Applied data cleaning, transformation, and modeling techniques to create accurate, dynamic, and visually engaging dashboards that enable strategic decision-making.
